# grammaticainformatica

An "applied opensource concept piece showcasing d3.js and experimental ultra-minimal design."  While helping noobies to learn about the basics of web design (by exposing code examples and providing an entire simple, "old school" - i.e. non-compiled and serverless,  front-end website) while simultaneously supplying links critical to learning about various kinds of software development is first and foremost on our mind, the site is also intended as a resource to stay abreast of cool ideas at the edge of software (philosophy and computer science in general) and to help non-technical people gain a better understanding of what's going on in the software world right now.

If you've made it here, chances are that you arrived from our live site at http://www.grammaticainformatica.com!

If so, you're probably looking to use our code for your own creative purposes! Rock on! We ask only that you code cite, fork, and star us on GitHub! Our code cannot be used for illegal or nefarious purposes. Otherwise, you're free to use our code as you wish.

The technologies at use in the actual website are:

JavaScript, Node, Express, jQuery, CSS3, Google Fonts, Google Analytics, HTML5, Arbor.js, d3.js, JSON, and various CodePen.io snippets (cited).  We've kept it as simple as possible to make it easier for new users to learn.  As this project progress, newer, swifter technologies may be added.

Here we also tested the concept of providing multiple user experiences based on browser - randomization of "mottos" also included.
 
Technically, our website runs on a NoSQL data layer. We're kinda proud of that and strongly advocate NoSQL frameworks (for these kinds of simple projects).

I do not claim that this is a comprehensive resource and indeed it is probably lacking in many ways. That being said, it is a resource containing the technologies I have most often used and that have come up in discussions about development. The site will be periodically updated.

Any issues that arise from using our code we can't be held responsible for though we will try to fix the issue on our side if there is one.  Sorry, you've been warned.  

Here's what you do to get started: click on the right-hand side and download the .zip.  Run it through an anti-virus software (or a couple - you should always do that).  Extract the 'root' folder to your desktop or wherever.  Use an IDE to look at the code (check out the 'frontend.html' file for all the tools you'll need) or your regular web-browser to actually view the rendered files.  

To deploy the website, you actually need to have a webhosting (see 'infrastructure.html') service.  Copy all the files out from the root and put them into the main root folder of the webhosting service you choose.  There are no database requirements for this website so don't worry about that.

I've also pulled out the visualization library code and placed into a directory of it's own.  Should work right out of the box.  Ditto for Paypal and Bitcoin donation buttons (watch out!  They're hooked up to my accounts).  

Enjoy and have fun coding!
